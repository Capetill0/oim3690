# Learning Log Week 04 (02/10-02/12)

## Review: 
- need to add "https://" because if not "babson.edu" is treated as a file, which isn't what we want. 
- if a website has two "h" tags it's okay it's just not suggested. 
- need to add alt to an image to being able to read description.
- "<div>" is like boxes or containers
- 

## What I learned today
- img doesnt have the ending because it's independent from text.
    - ex. cat image inside of paragraph
- "viewport" will make some that there is some responsiveness to your page
- "<br>" is a line break 
- "ctrl, shift, & i" invokes chat
- do not rely on inline suggestions
