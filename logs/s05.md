# Learning Log - Session 5 (02/03)

## What I learned today
- 404 means "not found" 
- If the code starts with 4 is usually means something ent wrong or there's some type of error.
- you can have a customized 404/not found page 
- computer downloads html files when viewing a webpage
- GET retrieves information while POST sends information to server
- GET is used more often since a browser uses GET everytime it opens up a webpage
- 

## Challenges I faced
- it took me a minute to find command prompt since I didn't know what that was
- i was having trouble understanding what was being done in command prompt and what everything meant like "tracert"
